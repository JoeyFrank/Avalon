Note: our version of the game only utilies the Merlin and Assassin character cards

Avalon is a 5-10 player card game with 2 different opposing sides. The number of good and evil players depends on how many overall players there are.

| Number of Players | Number of good guys | Number of bad guys |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| 5 | 3 | 2 |
| 6 | 4 | 2 |
| 7 | 4 | 3 |
| 8 | 5 | 3 |
| 9 | 6 | 3 |
| 10 | 6 | 4 |

One player on the good team will be Merlin and one player on the evil team will be the Assassin. At the start of the game, Merlin is given the identities of the evil characters, but he can't give away the fact that he knows this, because if the Assassin is able to learn who Merlin was, evil wins.

Whoever the leader is picks a team of the required number of players in hopes that their allegiance wins. Once a team is selected, all players vote on whether to approve or veto the team. If the team is vetoed, it becomes another person's turn to pick the team, and so on. If the team is approved, the team members are then given the option to succeed or fail the quest. If there is 1 fail or higher, the quest fails. The good guys are only able to succeed, but the bad guys are able to succeed or fail the mission. Succeeding may be a wise strategy for a villain so they don't appear evil.

| Number of Players | Required number for quest 1 | Required number for quest 2 | Required number for quest 3 | Required number for quest 4 | Required number for quest 5 |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ------ | --- | ---- |
| 5 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 
| 6 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 |
| 7 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 |
| 8 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 |
| 9 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 |
| 10 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 |

The first team to achieve 3 quests towards their alignment wins. However, if the good guys win, the Assassin is given the option to choose who Merlin was. If they are correct, evil wins. Otherwise, the good guys are victorious.

Good luck, and have fun deceiving your friends!
